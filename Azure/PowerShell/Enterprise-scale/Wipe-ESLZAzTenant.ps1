.DESCRIPTION
Fully resets an AAD tenant after deploying Enterprise Scale (Azure Landing Zone Accelerator) so it can be deployed again. BEWARE: THIS WILL DELETE ALL OF YOUR AZURE RESOURCES. USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION.

.EXAMPLE
# Without SPN Removal
.\Wipe-ESLZAzTenant.ps1 -tenantRootGroupID "f73a2b89-6c0e-4382-899f-ea227cd6b68f" -intermediateRootGroupID "Contoso"

# With SPN Removal
.\Wipe-ESLZAzTenant.ps1 -tenantRootGroupID "f73a2b89-6c0e-4382-899f-ea227cd6b68f" -intermediateRootGroupID "Contoso" -eslzAADSPNName = "Contoso-ESLZ-SPN"

# Required PowerShell Modules:
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-6.4.0
-Install-Module -Name Az.Resources
-Install-Module -Name Az.ResourceGraph

# Release notes 14/09/2021: 
- Initial release.
- GroupName has been changes to GroupId as per Az PowerShell module warning message 'upcoming breaking changes in the cmdlet 'Get-AzManagementGroup'as documented https://aka.ms/azps-changewarnings'
    - Warnings have been disabled!
- Uses Azure Resource Graph to get list of subscriptions in the Intermediate Root Management Group's hierarchy tree, therefore it can take a few minutes (5/10) for the Resoruce Graph data to refresh and pull all the Subscriptions in the tree, if recently moved between Management Groups
